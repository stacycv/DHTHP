My thought process:
- A good team balances eachother out. We already have people with high scores in intellegence and endurance. We may be more focused on someone who has high strength or high spice food tolerence. While all data may not need to be accounted for, there is always a reason why the data is taken. Based on the attributes, my best guess would be they are doing a spicy food trivia night.
