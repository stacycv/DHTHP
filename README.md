My thought process:
- A good team balances eachother out. We already have people with high scores in intellegence and endurance. Although, we shouldnt rule it out. We may be more focused on someone who has high strength or high spice food tolerence. These being weighed more. Based on the attributes, my best guess would be they are doing a spicy food trivia lifting night.
