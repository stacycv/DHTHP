My thought process:
- Based on the attributes, my best guess would be they are doing a spicy food trivia lifting night.
- A good team balances eachother out. We already have people with high scores in intellegence and endurance. Although, we shouldnt rule it out. We may be more focused on someone who has high strength or high spice food tolerence. 
- When calculating totals it was found that the team totals didnt have much difference in value, despite the stronger scores in certain attributes. All totals ranged from 11-13. When calculating how the compatibility score would be added, I listed off from the lowest team total to be weighed the most and the highest team totals(merged them because they weighed same) to be weighed the least. 

How to run:
Run using node. Input "node main.js" in terminal. Output will both be generated in both terminal and file.
